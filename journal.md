Robot Journal

Our group’s robot is the child in the story we are building for the Performing Robot project. 

We started by sketching the full design of the robot on paper to visualize its proportions and basic structure. The sketch helped us plan how to divide the body into separate parts—head, torso, and arms—and how to fit the motor and wiring inside.

<img src="images/1_robot_full_sketch.jpg" width="400"/>

After that, we began building the body using cardboard pieces. The main torso was formed from four boards, glued together to create a stable base. Each side of the body is made from an isosceles trapezoid, with the bottom edge measuring 30 mm and the top 40 mm. By gluing together four of these trapezoidal boards, we formed a tapered shape that looks a bit like a trash can, creating a cute, top-heavy silhouette. To make the panels stronger, we also cut rectangular reinforcement boards with the grain running perpendicular to the original cardboard and glued them inside to prevent bending and twisting.

<img src="images/2_body_4_board.jpg" width="400"/>

For the head, forming a true sphere with cardboard was impractical, so we used a ring-based method. We cut three circular rings: the bottom ring provides the base; the middle ring is hollowed to leave a channel for the LED face screen wiring; and the top structure comes from two rings that we trimmed into a ¼-circle and a ½-circle. We stood those curved pieces upright and glued them together to create a sturdy hemisphere with an internal pass-through for cables.

<img src="images/3_head.jpg" width="400"/>

After dry-fitting, we glued the ring segments and transitions, locking the hemisphere’s shape. This approach keeps the head light, cable-friendly, and visually round enough for an expressive “big-head” look.

<img src="images/4_head_with_glue.jpg" width="400"/>

We first glued only three of the four body panels together, leaving the back open for easier access during assembly. After the main shape was fixed, we cut several right-angle triangular pieces and attached them along the inner corners of the panels to reinforce the structure and keep the cardboard body stable.

<img src="images/5_inner_body.jpg" width="400"/>

With the head and body attached, the robot started to take shape. The proportions—big head, small body—created a slightly awkward but adorable silhouette.

<img src="images/6_full_body_with_neck.jpg" width="400"/>

After testing the fit, we completed the full body structure and checked that everything was well balanced.

<img src="images/7_full_body_without_arm.jpg" width="400"/>

Next, we began designing the motor holder. we first made a rough sketch to figure out the size and shape needed to support the servo motor securely. Instead of gluing the motor directly onto the cardboard body, we decided it would be stronger and more stable to mount it with nails and a wooden board. We cut a small piece of wood of suitable thickness and carved out a slot on the side that matched the motor’s dimensions, allowing it to fit perfectly and lock firmly in place.

<img src="images/8_motor_holder_sketch.jpg" width="400"/>

Then we started cutting the wooden holder using the band saw machine. The outer edges were easy to cut, and we shaped the piece into a U-like form. However, the two inner 90-degree corners were difficult to reach cleanly. To solve this, we tried a different approach: we made many thin parallel cuts in the section that needed to be removed, as shown in the picture, slicing it into narrow strips. Then we used other tools to chip away or sand off those small strips to hollow out the middle. This method worked, but the inner surface came out quite rough, and the process sometimes caused the wood layers to separate.

<img src="images/9_holder_cut_try.jpg" width="400"/>

Later, we asked Dustin for advice, and he showed us how to cut the inner 90-degree corners more effectively. He suggested starting from one side and cutting along a curved path, forming a quarter-circle that reaches one corner. Then, we made a vertical cut inward from that point, which naturally created a clean 90-degree angle. We repeated the same method on the other side, and finally used the machine to smooth out the uneven middle section—and the piece came out perfectly.

<img src="images/10_holder_cut.jpg" width="400"/>

For the woodworking part, we also cut small wooden blocks to serve as the base supports. Since the base holds components like the battery, Arduino, and other electronics, we needed another wooden board above it to connect with the body section. However, we noticed that the front and back wheels were different in size, which made the base tilt forward instead of staying level. To fix this, we measured the height difference between the front and back of the base, then cut and sanded the small wooden blocks at matching angles. This way, when we placed the upper wooden board on top, it sat perfectly horizontal.

<img src="images/11_holder_and_base_support.jpg" width="400"/>

After completing all the preparation, we cut matching holes on both the left and right side panels of the body, each sized precisely to fit the motor holder. This allowed the holder to slot perfectly into the side boards, making the entire structure much more stable and secure.

<img src="images/12_motor_attached_front.jpg" width="400"/> <img src="images/13_motor_attached_back.jpg" width="400"/>

We then drilled two holes in the wooden board according to the screw positions designed on the motor itself, and used nails to fasten it firmly in place. This ensured that the motor stayed securely attached and the whole structure remained stable during movement.

<img src="images/14_holder_with_screws_front.jpg" width="400"/> <img src="images/15_holder_with_screws_back.jpg" width="400"/>

The lower wooden block was connected to the base using an L-bracket. We drilled holes in the base and secured the L-bracket with machine screws and nuts. However, because the wooden block was quite thick and the bolts weren’t long enough, we switched to wood screws instead. We first drilled small pilot holes slightly narrower than the screw diameter, then used the drill to drive the wood screws directly into the block. This way, the side of the L-bracket was firmly attached to the wooden block. The upper wooden board was also fixed to the block using the same type of wood screws, creating a solid and stable layered structure.

<img src="images/16_wood_screw.jpg" width="400"/> <img src="images/17_drill_wood_screw.jpg" width="400"/>

We then finish the base of the robot, attaching the horizontal support board where the wheels and lower parts would connect. With all the angled supports and adjustments in place, this created a perfectly level surface that could be securely connected to the body.

<img src="images/18_base_with_horizontal_board.jpg" width="400"/>

The next step was constructing the arms. For the cardboard arm, we cut small square and rectangular pieces of cardboard and used hot glue to assemble them into a rectangular box shape. The wrist section was made from a thin strip of cardboard rolled into a cylinder, which connected the box-shaped arm to the hand, a small cube at the end.

<img src="images/19_cardboard_arm.jpg" width="400"/>

We also cut four rounded cardboard fingers of different lengths and attached them to the bottom of the cube hand, making it look more like a human-shaped hand and creating a strong contrast with the metal wire arm on the other side.

<img src="images/20_full_cardboard_arm.jpg" width="400"/>

Next, we connected the arm to the motor’s horn. We cut a small rectangular cardboard plate and carved a horn-shaped slot in it so the horn could slide snugly into the thickness of the plate. Then we used hot glue to bond the plate to the horn and glued the arm to the plate. This gave us a larger bonding area and a much stronger, more reliable connection between the arm and the motor.

<img src="images/21_cardboard_arm_to_motor.jpg" width="400"/>

For the metal arm on the other side, we found wire mesh in the scene shop. 

<img src="images/22_wire_mesh.jpg" width="400"/> 

It was very stiff, so we used bolt cutters to cut a 90-degree V-notch in the middle of the cylindrical mesh. This notch let us fold the mesh to a clean 90-degree bend. We then overlapped the two sides along the fold and secured the seam with zip ties, which locked the mesh into a stable tubular shape while keeping it lightweight and slightly flexible.

<img src="images/23_wire_mesh_45_cut.jpg" width="400"/> <img src="images/24_wire_mesh_fold.jpg" width="400"/>

To fit the storyline, we designed the robot so that its metal arm holds a small hammer. At the end of the wire-mesh arm, we created a U-shaped hand using cardboard pieces cut to shape and attached them to the wire frame with hot glue. This design made the robot’s gesture clearer and connected it better to the narrative of the performance.

<img src="images/25_u_hand.jpg" width="400"/>

Next, we connected the wire-mesh arm to the motor horn. We threaded four zip ties through different openings of the mesh and cinched them around the horn to hold it in place. Then we applied a thick layer of hot glue over the contact area between the mesh and the horn, increasing the bonding surface and making the connection much more secure. Then, the whole arm was finished. 

<img src="images/26_wire_arm_to_motor.jpg" width="400"/> <img src="images/27_full_wire_arm.jpg" width="400"/>

After finishing both arms, we started preparing to install the Arduino Mega. Since we didn’t yet have the circuit board and a proper holder for the Mega, we temporarily connected the motor wires directly to the board just to test whether the arms could move properly with the motors. During testing, we discovered that the motor on the wire-mesh arm wasn’t functioning correctly, so we had to fully disassemble the setup, remove the motor, and replace it with a new one before reattaching everything. This process took quite a lot of time, and we learned that it’s better to complete all motor testing before assembling to avoid the need for rework later.

<img src="images/28_test_motor.jpg" width="400"/>

Then, we assembled the neck. To let the head rotate, we used a turntable swivel bearing (a “lazy Susan” bearing). We planned for the top plate of the bearing to be driven by the motor, so we first cut a motor-sized rectangular opening in the top cover board of the body and pressed the motor in for a snug, press fit. We then used hot glue along the motor’s mounting ears to bond them to the cardboard, preventing any wobble. From the side view, the motor shaft sat slightly higher than the top plate of the bearing, so we shimmed under the bearing with an extra layer of cardboard. This brought the motor horn and the bearing’s top plate to the same height, making the rotation interface aligned and stable.

<img src="images/29_neck_side.jpg" width="400"/> <img src="images/30_neck_above.jpg" width="400"/>

We mounted the bearing by fastening both sides with hardware: the lower plate of the lazy-Susan bearing to the top deck of the body, and the upper plate to the head’s cardboard plate. For both connections, we drilled holes and used machine screws with nuts (and washers where needed) to secure everything tightly. On the top cardboard plate, we also cut a horn-shaped opening so the motor horn could seat directly into the plate; this way the horn keys into the cardboard and drives the bearing’s upper plate smoothly as it rotates.

<img src="images/31_neck_connection.jpg" width="400"/>

We then cut another circular cardboard plate the same size as the underside of the head and used generous hot glue to bond it to the upper bearing plate, finishing the neck connection. We did not permanently glue the head onto this plate yet, because we may still need to cut openings in the circle or mount the LED face screen and other components (possibly another small motor). Keeping it unglued preserves access for wiring and adjustments.

<img src="images/32_head_base.jpg" width="400"/> <img src="images/33_full_head.jpg" width="400"/>

By this point, the outer body structure was mostly finished, but it looked a bit too much like a real trash can. To make the robot cuter and softer, we decided to trim off the four top corners of the body—cutting out an equilateral triangle of 15 cm at each corner. This chamfered transition removes the harsh edges and gives the torso a rounder, friendlier silhouette.

<img src="images/34_full_body.jpg" width="400"/>

Next, we prepared to wire the motors to the Arduino Mega. Since the center of the body is hollow, we added a cardboard crossbeam inside as a shelf for the Mega. The beam spans left–right, attaching to the two side panels, while we kept the front and back open to route cables cleanly. This crossbeam not only provides a stable mounting platform for the board but also stiffens the torso, making the whole body more rigid.

<img src="images/35_arduino_mega_shelf.jpg" width="400"/>


* Compared to the list above, what did you accomplish for last Thursday (October 23)?
  We have already completed everything we wrote, including connecting the body and base, the head and body, making two arms and controlling both arms using two motors. Since we don't have the circuit board on top of the arduino mega, we connect the servos to the arduino using jumper cables to test every motor work can work well. 
* What will you accomplish for this Thursday October 30?
  We plan to connect three servos to the Arduino Mega and make sure they can move properly. We also aim to complete the rotating antenna on the head, finish building the hammer for the hand, and design the structure for the eyes and other parts of the head.
* What features remain to be implemented?
  We still need to decorate the entire robot, build the outer shell for the head and other components, and reinforce the joints and connections between the arms and shoulders to ensure stable movement.

For the final moment of our play, the child robot needs to “end the case” by striking a judge’s gavel. To prepare for this, I started prototyping a lightweight gavel using simple cardboard materials. I first experimented with a plastic tube we found earlier, but it was still surprisingly heavy for the robot’s servo to lift comfortably. Eventually, I discovered that the inner cardboard tube from a decorative paper roll was much lighter. I cut a 30 cm segment to serve as the handle. 

<img src="images/36_hammar_material.jpg" width="400"/>

For the gavel head, I rolled and layered pieces of cardboard into a cylindrical form. This combination keeps the prop structurally solid while remaining light enough for the robot to swing during performance.

<img src="images/37_full_hammar.jpg" width="400"/>

We wanted to place a small antenna on top of the robot’s head, so the antenna motor needed to be securely mounted onto the top cardboard panel. The motor requires its plastic holder to be nailed in place, so we first attached the motor to the holder using small nails. Then we fixed the holder onto the cardboard head panel with another set of nails. However, the cardboard turned out to be thinner and softer than expected, so the nails alone didn’t provide enough stability. To reinforce it, we added several layers of tape around the holder to keep the motor firmly attached. This ensures the antenna can rotate smoothly without the whole mount wobbling.

<img src="images/38_neck_motor_attach.jpg" width="400"/>

To design the antenna, we first sketched a rough outline directly on a photo of the robot. We imagined how a bamboo stick would sit on the motor shaft and rotate as the motor turns. Using the photo as reference, we estimated the overall size and silhouette of the antenna so it would look balanced on the robot’s head. After finalizing the rough shape, we cut the antenna pieces out of cardboard. Once the pieces were shaped properly, we assembled them and used hot glue to secure everything in place. This created a lightweight, stable antenna structure that the motor could rotate smoothly.

<img src="images/39_antenna_motor.jpg" width="400"/><img src="images/40_antenna_try.jpg" width="400"/>

After assembling the antenna structure, we moved on to wiring the NeoPixel LED panels and the motor to the Arduino Mega. Once everything was connected, we uploaded our test code—but the LED panel didn’t light up at all. Our first suspicion was that something might have gone wrong during soldering. We wondered if we had accidentally damaged the LED board, caused a short inside the panel, or broken one of the input/output pads.

Our professor suggested using a multimeter to check whether the panel itself was still functional. After testing continuity and measuring the connections, the board seemed perfectly fine. 

<img src="images/41_test_eye.jpg" width="400"/>

So we went back to the code. Eventually, we discovered the real issue: we had written the matrix dimensions in the wrong order. Because we were chaining two NeoPixel panels together, the matrix could be interpreted in two ways: 16 × 8 and 8 × 16. We had been assuming 8 × 16 the entire time, which caused the pixel mapping to be completely incorrect—making the board look like it wasn’t lighting up at all. After switching it to the correct 16 × 8, the LEDs finally displayed exactly what we coded. It turned out to be a coordinate-mapping bug, not a hardware problem.

<img src="images/42_led_eye.jpg" width="400"/>

We ran into a series of unexpected problems while testing the LED strip. At first, the strip wouldn’t light at all, and we couldn’t figure out why. Our professor suggested trying it with an Arduino Uno and one of the sample codes from the NeoPixel library. Surprisingly, the LED strip lit up normally on the Uno, which meant the strip itself wasn’t the issue.

However, when we connected the same strip to the Mega, only the very first LED lit up, and one more LED further down glowed extremely dim. When we touched the strip, it felt very hot, and even the wires near the connection point were heating up. This made us suspect that the strip might have been damaged during soldering—possibly a short circuit between the copper pads and the wires.

We replaced it with a brand-new LED strip. As soon as we powered it through the Mega, the LEDs became extremely bright, much brighter than expected. That immediately made us nervous, so we unplugged it right away to avoid burning it again.

<img src="images/43_led_strip_light.jpg" width="400"/>

After carefully tracing the connections, we finally discovered the real problem: the Mega was being powered from the wrong port of the power bank. The USB output provides 5V, which is what both the LED strip and the motor require. But earlier, we had accidentally plugged the Mega into the 12V output of the power bank. Feeding 12V into a system meant for 5V caused the LED strip to over-brighten and overheat, especially since the faulty soldering introduced additional shorting points. Fixing the power connection and replacing the strip resolved the issue.

<img src="images/45_power_bank_output.jpg" width="400"/>

After confirming the strip worked safely, we placed it inside the wire-mesh arm structure. The mesh itself is not visually strong enough on stage, so adding the LED strip inside makes the arm more visible and expressive under stage lighting.

<img src="images/44_led_arm.jpg" width="400"/>

After finishing all the individual components, we finally completed the full wiring layout on the Arduino Mega. In total, the robot uses six active ports, each responsible for a different moving or lighting feature. The left and right arms each have one motor, the neck has another motor for head rotation, and the antenna is driven by its own motor mounted on top of the head. For visuals, we connected two NeoPixel devices: one LED matrix for the eyes and one LED strip embedded inside the wire-mesh arm. With all six ports configured and powered correctly, the Mega now serves as the central hub coordinating every motion and lighting effect in the robot.

<img src="images/46_arduino_mega_connected.jpg" width="400"/>

We also created a full power-system diagram to keep track of how every component is supplied. Both the Arduino Uno and the Arduino Mega are powered using the Anker power bank’s 5V USB output, ensuring stable and safe voltage for all the logic-level electronics. The two large motors at the base of the robot require a much higher voltage, so they are powered separately using the 12V output from the larger power bank.

All the motors and LED strips connected to the Mega run exclusively on 5V, supplied through the same power bank’s USB port. Drawing this diagram helped us clearly separate the 12V and 5V circuits, preventing accidental mis-wiring and avoiding the overheating issues we previously encountered.

After testing the eye LEDs and confirming the correct orientation of the LED panels, our next step was to permanently mount the lights onto the head structure. To do this, we cut two small trapezoid-shaped pieces of cardboard that could fit snugly between the two vertical support plates inside the head. These pieces acted as mounting brackets. We fixed the cardboard brackets in place using hot glue, ensuring they were stable and aligned properly. Then, instead of using hot glue directly on the LED panels (to avoid potential heat damage), we attached the LED boards to the cardboard mounts using double-sided tape. This method allowed us to securely fix the eyes in position while protecting the electronics from heat.

<img src="images/48_eye_holder.jpg" width="400"/><img src="images/49_eye_holder_attached.jpg" width="400"/>

At this point, all of the robot’s structural components were completed. With the physical structure finalized, we were able to shift our focus away from construction and problem-solving and move into the decoration phase. This next stage involved refining the robot’s visual identity and expressive details, building on the completed mechanical framework to enhance its character and stage presence.

<img src="images/50_full_naked_robot.jpg" width="400"/>

To make the robot appear more mechanical and less purely cardboard-based, we sourced metallic-colored paint from the scene shop and used it to coat the robot’s body. This metallic finish helped unify the structure visually and enhanced the robot’s machine-like presence, transforming the raw cardboard form into something that more clearly reads as a constructed, mechanical object rather than a prototype.

<img src="images/51_body_painted.jpg" width="400"/>

The head structure was supported by eight quarter-circle cardboard ribs that together formed a hemispherical frame. To enclose this structure while giving the robot a balance of a technological appearance and a childlike, playful quality, we sourced transparent, colored lighting gels from the equipment center. We cut the gels into triangular pieces sized to cover one-eighth of the hemisphere each. These pieces were then attached one by one using hot glue, gradually enclosing the dome. For the front section where the eyes are located, we cut square openings in the gel so that the LED eye panels could remain visible and unobstructed. This approach allowed the head to feel enclosed and polished while still maintaining a soft, expressive visual quality.

<img src="images/52_gel_covered_head.jpg" width="400"/>

We also painted the antenna silver to match the rest of the robot’s metallic body. However, once assembled, we felt that the top of the head appeared too dark and did not stand out clearly on stage. To enhance its visibility and visual impact, we decided to integrate additional lighting into the antenna structure. Specifically, we placed two circular LED rings inside the two openings of the antenna, which resemble an infinity symbol. We programmed the LEDs so that the light travels around the two rings in a continuous figure-eight–like sequence, with rainbow-colored pixels and a fading tail that gradually diminishes in brightness. Special care was taken to ensure that the colors connect smoothly at the point where the two rings meet, maintaining visual continuity.

<img src="images/53_antenna_light.jpg" width="400"/>

At the same time, we felt that the head itself still lacked brightness and did not fully highlight the transparency of the colored gel covering. To address this, we added an LED strip inside the head and set it to emit a constant white light. This internal illumination makes the head appear softly glowing from the outside and enhances the gel’s visual effect. Both the circular LED rings and the internal LED strip were daisy-chained together and connected to a separate Arduino Uno, allowing them to remain continuously lit during the performance.

At this stage, all of the head-related electronics were fully connected. Because a large number of wires were routed through the head and down into the body, we spent time doing wire management to improve both functionality and appearance. We first grouped wires that traveled in the same direction using zip ties, then secured them to stable surfaces with electrical tape wherever possible. We intentionally left a small amount of slack near the head joint to allow for rotation without placing stress on the connections. This process made the back of the robot appear significantly cleaner and more organized.

One issue we encountered was related to workflow order. We had fully enclosed the head with gel before completing the wiring for the antenna LEDs and the internal head lighting. As a result, we had to remove one section of the gel, finish the internal connections, and then reattach it. This experience highlighted that all internal structures and wiring should be finalized before sealing the head. Planning the enclosure step later in the process would have made the build smoother, more efficient, and less prone to rework.

<img src="images/54_wire_from_head.jpg" width="400"/>

Next, we began decorating the painted robot body. To make the robot feel more like a child character, we drew simple, childlike illustrations on the lower part of its body. These drawings helped soften the mechanical appearance and added a playful, innocent quality to the robot’s overall look. To further enhance the visual presence and make the body appear more lively on stage, we borrowed a string of colorful lights from the equipment center and wrapped them around the robot’s torso. Any excess length of the light string was carefully coiled and placed inside a paper bag, which was then secured inside the robot’s body to keep the wiring contained and organized. The image below shows the final visual effect after these decorations were added.

<img src="images/55_robot_with_light_drawing_sample.jpg" width="400"/>

We then continued decorating the front and both sides of the robot using watercolor paint, adding simple line drawings and playful figures. Placing these childlike illustrations on top of the metallic surface created a deliberate contrast between the robot’s mechanical body and its innocent, youthful character. This combination helped the robot feel more approachable and expressive, making it read more clearly as a child figure rather than a purely mechanical object. The final result, shown in the image above, visually supports the story by reinforcing the robot’s role as a child within the narrative.

<img src="images/56_robot_finished_drawing.jpg" width="400"/>

After completing the exterior decoration, we moved on to writing and testing the case-based control code for the robot. We sourced two distinct voice types from the ElevenLabs platform: one was a soft, childlike voice representing the robot’s outward persona, while the other was a sharply contrasting, mechanical-sounding voice. In the narrative, the mechanical voice is used for explanatory or interpretive lines that clarify the child’s dialogue, creating a clear separation between the robot’s inner logic and its expressed character. Additionally, the child’s recurring vocalizations (“meemee mawmaw”) were recorded using Torico’s voice and processed through voice-modulation software to make them sound more like a generated child’s voice.

During the coding and testing process, we encountered a number of technical challenges. These included coordinating LED animations and motor movements simultaneously, ensuring that the LEDs did not draw too much power and cause motor jitter, correcting arm movement directions, synchronizing audio playback with physical actions, and coordinating the motion of the eyes, head, and antenna. We also had to troubleshoot communication issues related to the transmitter. Through extensive debugging and iterative testing, we were eventually able to run through all programmed cases smoothly and reliably.

One mechanical issue emerged due to the frequency of arm movement: the right arm, which was constructed using metal mesh and held a relatively heavy judge’s gavel, began to tilt outward each time it was raised. To resolve this, we reinforced the arm by securing it more tightly to the motor using multiple zip ties, effectively wrapping and stabilizing the connection. This adjustment significantly improved the arm’s stability and allowed it to perform repeated motions without drifting out of alignment.

<img src="images/57_strengthen_arm.jpg" width="400"/><img src="images/58_strengthen_arm2.jpg" width="400"/>

Because the arm was moving repeatedly forward and backward, its wide hand and the added weight of the gavel increased the amplitude of the motion and caused instability. To prevent the arm from swinging outward or colliding with the front of the body when returning to its resting position, we needed to ensure that the arm’s movement path remained parallel to the robot’s torso and followed the side of the body closely. By constraining the motion in this way, the arm could complete its full range of movement without catching on the front surface or deviating from its intended trajectory.

<img src="images/59_arm_parallel.jpg" width="400"/>

The interior of the robot’s body contained many components, including the speaker used for audio playback, a power bank connected to the Arduino, and the string lights. As the number of internal elements increased, the space became cluttered and difficult to manage. To organize the interior more effectively, we reused several triangular cardboard pieces and attached them to the inner walls on both sides, creating designated compartments for each component. This approach helped secure every element in its own position, making the interior layout cleaner and more structured. It also ensured that components would not shift, tangle, or fall out while the robot was operating.

<img src="images/60_inner_body_space.jpg" width="400"/>

Before going on stage, we installed the string lights and thoroughly tested all cases and individual components to ensure everything was functioning properly. We rehearsed the performance multiple times. And it turns out that the final performance was the most successful visually and theatrically, only a minor issue occurred during the last case that concluded the play: the robot’s gavel did not lower, and the expected impact sound did not play. Despite this small malfunction, the overall performance was highly successful. Seeing the robot operate smoothly on stage after extensive building, debugging, and rehearsing was deeply rewarding and gave us a strong sense of accomplishment.

<img src="images/61_final_robot.jpg" width="400"/>
