Robot Journal

Our group’s robot is the child in the story we are building for the Performing Robot project. 

We started by sketching the full design of the robot on paper to visualize its proportions and basic structure. The sketch helped us plan how to divide the body into separate parts—head, torso, and arms—and how to fit the motor and wiring inside.

After that, we began building the body using cardboard pieces. The main torso was formed from four boards, glued together to create a stable base. Each side of the body is made from an isosceles trapezoid, with the bottom edge measuring 30 mm and the top 40 mm. By gluing together four of these trapezoidal boards, we formed a tapered shape that looks a bit like a trash can, creating a cute, top-heavy silhouette. To make the panels stronger, we also cut rectangular reinforcement boards with the grain running perpendicular to the original cardboard and glued them inside to prevent bending and twisting.

For the head, forming a true sphere with cardboard was impractical, so we used a ring-based method. We cut three circular rings: the bottom ring provides the base; the middle ring is hollowed to leave a channel for the LED face screen wiring; and the top structure comes from two rings that we trimmed into a ¼-circle and a ½-circle. We stood those curved pieces upright and glued them together to create a sturdy hemisphere with an internal pass-through for cables.

After dry-fitting, we glued the ring segments and transitions, locking the hemisphere’s shape. This approach keeps the head light, cable-friendly, and visually round enough for an expressive “big-head” look.

We first glued only three of the four body panels together, leaving the back open for easier access during assembly. After the main shape was fixed, we cut several right-angle triangular pieces and attached them along the inner corners of the panels to reinforce the structure and keep the cardboard body stable.

With the head and body attached, the robot started to take shape. The proportions—big head, small body—created a slightly awkward but adorable silhouette.

After testing the fit, we completed the full body structure and checked that everything was well balanced.

Next, we began designing the motor holder. we first made a rough sketch to figure out the size and shape needed to support the servo motor securely. Instead of gluing the motor directly onto the cardboard body, we decided it would be stronger and more stable to mount it with nails and a wooden board. We cut a small piece of wood of suitable thickness and carved out a slot on the side that matched the motor’s dimensions, allowing it to fit perfectly and lock firmly in place.

Then we started cutting the wooden holder using the band saw machine. The outer edges were easy to cut, and we shaped the piece into a U-like form. However, the two inner 90-degree corners were difficult to reach cleanly. To solve this, we tried a different approach: we made many thin parallel cuts in the section that needed to be removed, as shown in the picture, slicing it into narrow strips. Then we used other tools to chip away or sand off those small strips to hollow out the middle. This method worked, but the inner surface came out quite rough, and the process sometimes caused the wood layers to separate.

<img src="images/9_holder_cut_try.jpg" width="400"/>

Later, we asked Dustin for advice, and he showed us how to cut the inner 90-degree corners more effectively. He suggested starting from one side and cutting along a curved path, forming a quarter-circle that reaches one corner. Then, we made a vertical cut inward from that point, which naturally created a clean 90-degree angle. We repeated the same method on the other side, and finally used the machine to smooth out the uneven middle section—and the piece came out perfectly.

<img src="images/10_holder_cut.jpg" width="400"/>

For the woodworking part, we also cut small wooden blocks to serve as the base supports. Since the base holds components like the battery, Arduino, and other electronics, we needed another wooden board above it to connect with the body section. However, we noticed that the front and back wheels were different in size, which made the base tilt forward instead of staying level. To fix this, we measured the height difference between the front and back of the base, then cut and sanded the small wooden blocks at matching angles. This way, when we placed the upper wooden board on top, it sat perfectly horizontal.

<img src="images/11_holder_and_base_support.jpg" width="400"/>

After completing all the preparation, we cut matching holes on both the left and right side panels of the body, each sized precisely to fit the motor holder. This allowed the holder to slot perfectly into the side boards, making the entire structure much more stable and secure.

<img src="images/12_motor_attached_front.jpg" width="400"/> <img src="images/13_motor_attached_back.jpg" width="400"/>

We then drilled two holes in the wooden board according to the screw positions designed on the motor itself, and used nails to fasten it firmly in place. This ensured that the motor stayed securely attached and the whole structure remained stable during movement.

The lower wooden block was connected to the base using an L-bracket. We drilled holes in the base and secured the L-bracket with machine screws and nuts. However, because the wooden block was quite thick and the bolts weren’t long enough, we switched to wood screws instead. We first drilled small pilot holes slightly narrower than the screw diameter, then used the drill to drive the wood screws directly into the block. This way, the side of the L-bracket was firmly attached to the wooden block. The upper wooden board was also fixed to the block using the same type of wood screws, creating a solid and stable layered structure.

We then finish the base of the robot, attaching the horizontal support board where the wheels and lower parts would connect. With all the angled supports and adjustments in place, this created a perfectly level surface that could be securely connected to the body.

The next step was constructing the arms. For the cardboard arm, we cut small square and rectangular pieces of cardboard and used hot glue to assemble them into a rectangular box shape. The wrist section was made from a thin strip of cardboard rolled into a cylinder, which connected the box-shaped arm to the hand, a small cube at the end.

<img src="images/19_cardboard_arm.jpg" width="400"/>

We also cut four rounded cardboard fingers of different lengths and attached them to the bottom of the cube hand, making it look more like a human-shaped hand and creating a strong contrast with the metal wire arm on the other side.

<img src="images/20_full_cardboard_arm.jpg" width="400"/>

Next, we connected the arm to the motor’s horn. We cut a small rectangular cardboard plate and carved a horn-shaped slot in it so the horn could slide snugly into the thickness of the plate. Then we used hot glue to bond the plate to the horn and glued the arm to the plate. This gave us a larger bonding area and a much stronger, more reliable connection between the arm and the motor.

For the metal arm on the other side, we found wire mesh in the scene shop. 

<img src="images/22_wire_mesh.jpg" width="400"/> 

It was very stiff, so we used bolt cutters to cut a 90-degree V-notch in the middle of the cylindrical mesh. This notch let us fold the mesh to a clean 90-degree bend. We then overlapped the two sides along the fold and secured the seam with zip ties, which locked the mesh into a stable tubular shape while keeping it lightweight and slightly flexible.

<img src="images/23_wire_mesh_45_cut.jpg" width="400"/> <img src="images/24_wire_mesh_fold.jpg" width="400"/>

To fit the storyline, we designed the robot so that its metal arm holds a small hammer. At the end of the wire-mesh arm, we created a U-shaped hand using cardboard pieces cut to shape and attached them to the wire frame with hot glue. This design made the robot’s gesture clearer and connected it better to the narrative of the performance.

<img src="images/25_u_hand.jpg" width="400"/>

Next, we connected the wire-mesh arm to the motor horn. We threaded four zip ties through different openings of the mesh and cinched them around the horn to hold it in place. Then we applied a thick layer of hot glue over the contact area between the mesh and the horn, increasing the bonding surface and making the connection much more secure. Then, the whole arm was finished. 

<img src="images/26_wire_arm_to_motor.jpg" width="400"/> <img src="images/27_full_wire_arm.jpg" width="400"/>

After finishing both arms, we started preparing to install the Arduino Mega. Since we didn’t yet have the circuit board and a proper holder for the Mega, we temporarily connected the motor wires directly to the board just to test whether the arms could move properly with the motors. During testing, we discovered that the motor on the wire-mesh arm wasn’t functioning correctly, so we had to fully disassemble the setup, remove the motor, and replace it with a new one before reattaching everything. This process took quite a lot of time, and we learned that it’s better to complete all motor testing before assembling to avoid the need for rework later.

Then, we assembled the neck. To let the head rotate, we used a turntable swivel bearing (a “lazy Susan” bearing). We planned for the top plate of the bearing to be driven by the motor, so we first cut a motor-sized rectangular opening in the top cover board of the body and pressed the motor in for a snug, press fit. We then used hot glue along the motor’s mounting ears to bond them to the cardboard, preventing any wobble. From the side view, the motor shaft sat slightly higher than the top plate of the bearing, so we shimmed under the bearing with an extra layer of cardboard. This brought the motor horn and the bearing’s top plate to the same height, making the rotation interface aligned and stable.

<img src="images/29_neck_side.jpg" width="400"/> <img src="images/30_neck_above.jpg" width="400"/>

We mounted the bearing by fastening both sides with hardware: the lower plate of the lazy-Susan bearing to the top deck of the body, and the upper plate to the head’s cardboard plate. For both connections, we drilled holes and used machine screws with nuts (and washers where needed) to secure everything tightly. On the top cardboard plate, we also cut a horn-shaped opening so the motor horn could seat directly into the plate; this way the horn keys into the cardboard and drives the bearing’s upper plate smoothly as it rotates.

<img src="images/31_neck_connection.jpg" width="400"/>

We then cut another circular cardboard plate the same size as the underside of the head and used generous hot glue to bond it to the upper bearing plate, finishing the neck connection. We did not permanently glue the head onto this plate yet, because we may still need to cut openings in the circle or mount the LED face screen and other components (possibly another small motor). Keeping it unglued preserves access for wiring and adjustments.

By this point, the outer body structure was mostly finished, but it looked a bit too much like a real trash can. To make the robot cuter and softer, we decided to trim off the four top corners of the body—cutting out an equilateral triangle of 15 cm at each corner. This chamfered transition removes the harsh edges and gives the torso a rounder, friendlier silhouette.

<img src="images/34_full_body.jpg" width="400"/>

Next, we prepared to wire the motors to the Arduino Mega. Since the center of the body is hollow, we added a cardboard crossbeam inside as a shelf for the Mega. The beam spans left–right, attaching to the two side panels, while we kept the front and back open to route cables cleanly. This crossbeam not only provides a stable mounting platform for the board but also stiffens the torso, making the whole body more rigid.
